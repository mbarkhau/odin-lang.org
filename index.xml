      <description>General What is the history of the project? The project started one evening in late July 2016 when Ginger Bill was annoyed with programming in C++. During this annoyance, Bill was also a little drunk. The language began as a Pascal clone (with begin and end and more) but changed quite quickly to become something else.
Bill originally tried to create a preprocessor for C to augment and add new capabilities to the language however, found this endeavour a dead-end.</description>

      <description>Getting started with Odin Odin is dead-simple to get started with! Clone the repository (recommended, git clone https://github.com/gingerBill/Odin) or download the latest release
For Windows&amp;hellip; There&amp;rsquo;s a couple prerequisites here. First, make sure you have Visual Studio installed; you have to compile Odin from source, and Odin also requires link.exe from VS anyway. Also, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to download a couple LLVM binaries and move the bin folder in that zip file into your Odin directory.</description>

      <description>Introduction This article is a basic tutorial for the programming language Odin. This tutorial assumes a basic knowledge of programming concepts such as variables, statements, and types. It is recommend to read the Getting started with Odin guide.
Hellope! To begin this tour, let us start with a modified version of the famous &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; program:

      <description>Introduction This is a reference manual for the Odin programming language.
Odin is a general-purpose language designed for systems programming. It is a strongly typed language with manual memory management. Programs are constructed from packages.
Notation The syntax is specified using Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF):
Production = production_name &amp;quot;=&amp;quot; [ Expression ] &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; . Expression = Alternative { &amp;quot;|&amp;quot; Alternative } . Alternative = Term { Term } . Term = production_name | token [ &amp;quot;â€¦&amp;quot; token ] | Group | Option | Repetition .</description>
