      <description>General What is the history of the project? The project started one evening in late July 2016 when Ginger Bill was annoyed with programming in C++. During this annoyance, Bill was also a little drunk. The language began as a Pascal clone (with begin and end and more) but changed quite quickly to become something else.
Bill originally tried to create a preprocessor for C to augment and add new capabilities to the language however, found this endeavour a dead-end.</description>

      <description>Getting started with Odin Odin is dead-simple to get started with! Clone the repository (recommended, git clone https://github.com/gingerBill/Odin) or download the latest release
For Windows&amp;hellip; There&amp;rsquo;s a couple prerequisites here. First, make sure you have Visual Studio installed; you have to compile Odin from source, and Odin also requires link.exe from VS anyway. Also, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to download a couple LLVM binaries and move the bin folder in that zip file into your Odin directory.</description>
